## A few notes:
* The app is running on port 8000, if case of conflict, change port in package.json.
* When you call an api, make sure it's an asynchronous request (by making it a promise) to void memory leaks.
* To run the app, make sure you run "npm install" first thing to install all the dependencies.
* Happy coding! :)
